## What is Slither Fade?

Slither Fade is a challenging twist on the beloved classic. Instead of just growing, your snake is constantly **shrinking** every 7 seconds, losing a segment from its tail. You must eat food not just to grow, but to survive!

The game features two types of food:

* **Normal Food:** Makes your snake grow by one segment and increases your score.
* **Safe Food:** A special item that also makes you grow but crucially **adds 10 seconds** to your survival timer, delaying the next shrink.

> The goal is simple: survive as long as you can and get the highest score possible before you either run into an obstacle, your own tail, or shrink away into nothing!
